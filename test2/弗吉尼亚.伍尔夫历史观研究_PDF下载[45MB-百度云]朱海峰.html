Much research has been undertaken both in China and abroad on Leslie Stephen's negative influence on Virginia Woolf based on Virginia Woolf's description of her father as a family tyrant who constantly abused his wife and daughters. Virginia Woolf mentioned in letters, diary entries and essays that her father represented the Victorian patriarch, who forbade his daughters from receiving school education, bullied Vanessa Stephen over the extravagance of household expenditure, and drove Virginia Woolf into violent rages. In Leslie Stephen. As Mountaineer: '6Where Does Mont Blanc En,d, and Where Do / Beginl", Catherine W. Hollis mentioned that Leslie Stephen's mountaineering experiences influenced his "private, domestic life and his public, intellectual life" （Hollis 7） , and evoked his masculine achievement, which left Virginia Woolf the impression of being "brutal" and indulging "his rage before women" （Woolf, MB 145-146）. Hermione Lee quoted Leslie Stephen's comment on women's right: a wife "ought to obey her husband and carry out the view at which he deliberately amves" to argue that Leslie Stephen's "hostility to feminism was notorious" （Lee 62）. Hermione Lee also stated that Leslie Stephen's bad habits as a Victorian patriarch provided "a wonderful example of the Victorian patriarch on whom revenge has been taken" by Virginia Woolf's writing （Lee 73）. Chinese Woolf researcher Pan Jian argued in "Virginia Woolf's Assault on Patriarchy" that Woolf realized that the Victorian women were deprived the rights of receiving school education and were confined to private space, thus making them suppressed by family patriarchy （Pan Jian 96） .　　Much research has been focused on the link of Virginia Woolf's feminism and her rebellion against Leslie Stephen, the surrogate of the familial patriarch in the Victorian times, but neglected the positive aspect of her father's influence on her education and writing. In fact, Virginia held a self-conflicting attitude of extreme love and hatred towards Leslie Stephen all her life. On the one hand she criticized her father's patriarchal role in her works, but on the other hand she was also influenced by the positive aspect of her father who helped her lay "a solid grounding in English literature and history and that his critical ideas informed much of her own thinking about literature" （Hill 351）. Virginia Woolf mentioned in "A Sketch of the Past" that her father Leslie Stephen was a "cheery", "heart.y" and distinguished man as well as a "muscular agnostic" （Woolf, "A Sketch of the Past" 127）, who allowed her to read books in his library and encouraged her to be his literary successor. When Virginia Woolf received the same Clark lectureship at Cambridge University in 1932 which Leslie Stephen had been offered in 1883, she wrote in her diary entry for February 29, 1932 that "father would have blushed with pleasure could I have told him 30 years ago, that his daughter - my poor little Ginny - was to be asked to succeed him: the sort of compliment he would have liked" （Woolf, D IV 79）. Virginia Woolf's ambivalent emotion towards her father is accompanied with some accidents that her family encountered from her childhood to adulthood. Therefore, Virginia Woolf's emotional chaos of her family can not only help uncover more about her biography research, but it can also help researchers understand more about how the patriarchal culture in the Victorian times influenced her artistic creation and her ideas of femimsm.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫历史观研究》是一本研究小说的文学研究著作。　　英国现代主义文学大师弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫（1882-1941）一生致力于小说创作的革新，推动了现代主义文学的发展，还撰述了她所处时代的战争、妇女运动、同性恋现象以及大英帝国衰落等历史事件。　　伍尔夫认为历史与文学是相通的，只有通过文学文本才能感知历史。她的历史观与20世纪80年代的新历史主义思潮相比具有明显的超前性，因此被赞誉为新历史主义先驱。伍尔夫在现代主义作品中不仅再现了当时家庭父权文化、社会习俗和大英帝国压制下的“他者”历史，同时也展示了被压迫者与权力机构的话语交锋。其现代主义作品所体现的历史观和历史撰述观有助读者更深入地认识现代主义的历史困境，引发人们思考走出战争威胁的出路。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　朱海峰，男，吉林榆树人，1979年7月生，东北师范大学外国语学院讲师，文学博士，主要从事英美文学研究。曾在《外国文学评论》《外语教学》《当代外国文学》和《东北师大学报》等刊物发表多篇学术论文，并主持和参与多项科研项目。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
