　　《孤立子理论中的哈密顿方法(英文)》讲述了：the book is based on the hamiltonian
interpretation of the method, hence the title. methods of
differential geometry and hamiitonian formalism in particular are
very popular in modern mathematical physics. it is precisely the
general hamiltonian formalism that presents the inverse scattering
method in its most elegant form. moreover, the hamiltonian
formalism provides a link between classical and quantum mechanics.
so the book is not only an introduction to the classical soliton
theory but also the groundwork for the quantum theory of solitons,
to be discussed in another volume.
　　the book is addressed to specialists in mathematical physics.
this has determined the choice of material and the level of
mathematical rigour. we hope that it will also be of interest to
mathematicians of other specialities and to theoretical physicists
as well. still, being a mathematical treatise it does not contain
applications of soliton theory to specific physical
phenomena.
