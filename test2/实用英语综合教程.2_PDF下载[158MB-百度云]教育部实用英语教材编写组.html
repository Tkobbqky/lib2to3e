Is your hair tidy？ Your shirt freshly pressed？ Your dress clean？ Shoes polished？ So, your preparations complete, you have arrived at the office on time and are waiting to be called for the interview. If you are feeling a little nervous, take a few deep breaths and let them out slowly. Read through your curriculum vitae again so that it is fresh in your mind.5 When the interviewer or a secretary invites you in, try to show courtesy in your appearance and manner. Stand until you are invited to sit and then sit straight in the chair, do not lounge.

He or she probably just wants to know if you have opinions of your own, and whether you can speak sensibly and coherently. Look straight at the interviewer when you answer questions and if asked about your family or school speak with loyalty and affection. Call the interviewer "Sir" or "Madam" or use a name if you have been asked to do so. Keep your certificates and other documents until they are asked for. If you failed an exam or had a job before do not be afraid to talk about it. If you are asked what salary you expect, state the figure mentioned in the advertisement you replied to.7 If you sense that the interview is coming to an end, be ready with your queries. The interviewer may ask you if you have any questions but if you are not asked, wait for a suitable moment. You have as much right to be concerned about your future work as the interviewer has about your ability to do the job. Do no</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
