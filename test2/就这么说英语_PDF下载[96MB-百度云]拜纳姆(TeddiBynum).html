  《就这么说英语》内容简介：The purpose of this book is to offer abundant models of natural English conversations and provide opportunities to practice the language presented in them. The key element of each lesson is a short dialogue in Chinese followed by the same conversation in English. Although this is the order of presentation, it is not the order of composition: the Chinese version is a translation of the English rather than vice-versa. The rationale behind presenting the translation before the original is to give every student, regardless of level, a clear communication goal: try to say this in English.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
