　　In the entire course ofhistory， the liberation and progress of women have been indispensable to the liberation and progress of mankind. Since its inception， the Communist Party of China （CPC） has been struggling for women's liberation and gender equality. The founding of the People's Republic of China （PRC）in 1949 ushered in a new era for women in China， changing their social status from an oppressed and enslaved group in the past thousands of years to masters oftheir own fate.<br/>　　In recent 70 years， women's cause in China has been close-ly connected to the general growth of the CPC and the whole nation. Under the leadership of the CPC， the past few genera-tions of women have contributed greatly to social construction，reform， and development. As the Chinese nation is rising and growing richer and stronger， Chinese women's social status has undergone enormous changes.　　In the entire course ofhistory， the liberation and progress of women have been indispensable to the liberation and progress of mankind.

The founding of the People's Republic of China （PRC）in 1949 ushered in a new era for women in China， changing their social status from an oppressed and enslaved group in the past thousands of years to masters oftheir own fate.<br/>　　In recent 70 years， women's cause in China has been close-ly connected to the general growth of the CPC and the whole nation. Under the leadership of the CPC， the past few genera-tions of women have contributed greatly to social construction，reform， and development. As the Chinese nation is rising and growing richer and stronger， Chinese women's social status has undergone enormous changes.<br/>　　Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012， guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era， there has been a firmer belief in the future of women development based on Chinese socialism among Chi-nese women. In this background， women are able to exercise their democratic rights， participate in economic and social development， and benefit from the outcomes of reforms and development on an equal and legal basis. As masters of the nation， women now can find the best ways to fulfill themselves while gaining increasing senses of achievement， happiness， and safety， as witnessed by the historic accomplishments they have made so far.<br/>　　This white paper is issued specifically to make the achieve-ments of women's cause in the past 70 years since New China was founded fully known to the whole world.
