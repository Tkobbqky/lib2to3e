     this book consists of elevenchapters.
chapter 1 introduces basic concepts of guided missile. chapter 2
presents thefundamental concepts of vehicle dynamics. the forces
and moments acting on the vehicle arealso presented. chapter 3
discusses vehicle dynamical equations and kinematic equations.based
on small-disturbance theory, chapter 4 discusses vehicle
longitudinal state equationsand transfer functions. chapter 5 deals
with lateral state equations and transfer functions.chapter 6
presents fundamental principle of missile guidance and control
system. chapter 7focuses on guidance laws. autopilot design is
discussed in chapter 8. chapter 9 is devoted tocommand guidance
systems. chapter 10 focuses on homing guidance system. chapter 11
summarizes guidance and control system hardware-in-the-loop
simulation.
