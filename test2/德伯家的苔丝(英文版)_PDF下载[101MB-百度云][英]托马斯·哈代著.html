It is an ancient custom for women in the village to dance every holiday. For the May Day dance， they all wear white dresses. This May Day， a pretty girl named Tess had a red bow around her hair. The women saw a carriage pass by. Durbeyfield was in the carriage. They could hear him sing about his good fortune. Tess was ashamed.<br/>　　"Father is tired，" said Tess. Her face was red.<br/>　　The girls got on with the dance. The men watched and danced， too. Three young strangers stopped to look. They were brothers. The two elder brothers started walking again， but the youngest was interested in the girls. He danced with several women. On his way out， he saw Tess. He thought her attractive. She seemed sad because he had not danced with her He wanted to dance with her. He wanted to know her name. But it was too late. So he joined his older brothers.<br/>　　Tess saw the young stranger， too. But she was too worried about her father's strange appearance to pay much attention to him. When she got home， her family's small cottage saddened her. They only had one candle. The furniture was old. Six children lived in the tiny space. When Tess arrived， her mother was doing the laundry and putting the baby to bed. Joan Durbeyfield had many children. Taking care of them made her look old， but she was still a little bit pretty. Tess was pretty like her mother who had once been.<br/>　　"I'll help you， Mother，" Tess said.<br/>　　"I'm glad to see you. I have something to tell you，" said her mother. "They have found out that we're the oldest family in the county. Our real name is d'Urberville. You should be proud. And that's why your father was in the carriage. Some people thought it was because he had been drinking."<br/>　　"Will this help us?" asked Tess.<br/>　　"Oh， yes. Our famous family members should come to meet us the minute they hear."<br/>　　……</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>

　　王润霞，《床头灯英语丛书》策划者之，资深英语教育践行者。1998年以来她按照自己对英语教育的理解，引导女儿取得了一系列惊人的成绩：2004年北京市高考理科第二名，托福（TOEFL）673分（满分677分），清华大学电子工程系专业和综合成绩排名双项**，获得10多所美国**大学（普林斯顿、耶鲁、麻省理工、加州理工、斯坦福、康奈尔等）的全额奖学金，博士毕业后拿到了麦肯锡、波士顿、贝恩三大咨询公司的工作offer。<br/>　　我女儿为什么能在中国的语言环境中学好英语<br/>　　我女儿是在中国语言环境中学好其语的一个代表，她的经历或许会给国内正在学或准备学英语的人一些启示，帮助他们少走弯路，*终享受到学好英语所带来的益处。当然，你可能会觉得我孩子的情况很特殊，属于个例。但是，我的英语教学体会是：每个学生都是语言的天才，只要学习方法正确，英语没有学不好的。这些年我一共带了几百名学生，很多考上了世界名校，如美国麻省理工学院、宾夕法尼亚大学、耶鲁大学、康奈尔大学，英国伦敦大学学院等。这些学生都是普通的学生，关键是他们背后都站着一个大事不糊涂、肯为孩子付出、和孩子在正确道路上坚持到底的家长。<br/>
