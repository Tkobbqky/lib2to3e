thick and heaw in the streets of london that the lamps were lighted
and the shop windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an
odd-looking little girl sat in a cab with her father and was driven
rather slowly through the big thoroughfares.
　　she sat with her feet tucked under her, and leaned against her
father, who held her in his arm, as she stared out of the window at
the passing people with a queer old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her
big eyes.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
