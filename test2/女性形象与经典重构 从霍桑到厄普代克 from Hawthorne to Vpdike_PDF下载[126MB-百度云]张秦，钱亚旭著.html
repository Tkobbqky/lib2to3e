　Literature is a mirror of social ideas and images. It possesses the power either to nourish or to discourage certain values and ideals. As the most noteworthy， exemplary and authoritative work of all literature， literary canon exerts greater influence in this respect. After all， literary canon is of setting models in the society. The word "canon" is originally derived from ancient Greek word "kanon"， a measuring rod， meaning standard. Later， when Christianity took root in Europe， literary canon was widely accepted as the Bible， which has been a major force in shaping the religious belief and even cultural tradition in Europe. In the eighteenth century， as literature accomplished its modem transition and became an independent discipline， literary canon also assumed more secular functions of teaching and guiding， among which maintaining a hierarchy family relation as well as social order was of priority. Hence， stereotypical views on gender relation were justified and reinforced by the depictions of men and women in literature canon. In this sense， literar）r canon is just a living fossil of anthropology， recording and preserving the social patterns in different ages. By exploring the change of the female image in the literary canon， we are more likely to form a panoramic view of women status as well as the social development in the history.　Literature is a mirror of social ideas and images.

By exploring the change of the female image in the literary canon， we are more likely to form a panoramic view of women status as well as the social development in the history.<br/>　　American literature did not exist until the founding of the United States of America. Since then， a collection of literary canons has been selected and deemed important enough to be taught at schools， where the images of women have varied from time to time， from author to author. The portrayals of women in American literature are often affected by author's personal experience and more frequently by the social stereotype of women and female position. In the early nineteenth century， Washington Irving depicted the only female character in Rip Van Winkle as a flat， aggressive and bothersome figure， which indicated a generally negative view on women at that time. Around a century later， as women won more rights in society， women were no longer portrayed as disgusting but still vulnerable as F.Scott Fitzgerald did with Daisy Buchanan， a victim in the 1920's America.
