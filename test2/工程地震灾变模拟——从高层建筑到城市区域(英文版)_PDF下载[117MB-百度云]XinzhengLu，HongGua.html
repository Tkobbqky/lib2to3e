Xinzheng Lu、Hong Guan编*的《Earthquake  Disaster Simulation of Civil  Infrastructures(精)》简介：Based On more  than 12 years of systematic investigation on  earthquake disaster  simulation of civil  infrastructures, this book covers the major  research outcomes including anumber of novel  computational models, high performance  computing methods and realistic  visualization techniques for tall buildings  and urban areas, with particularemphasize on  collapse prevention and mitigation in  extreme earthquakes, earthquake loss  evaluation and seismic resilience. Typical  engineering applications to several tall-est  buildings in the world (e.g., the 632 m tall  Shanghai Tower and the 528 m tall Z15Tower)  and selected large cities in China (the  Beiiing Central Business District, Xi'an  City, Taiyuan City and Tangshan City) are  also introduced to demonstrate the advan- tages of the proposed computational models  and techniques.    The high-fidelity computational model  developed in this book has proven to be the   onlyfeasible option to date for earthquake- induced collapse simulation of supertall  buildings that are higher than 5o0 m. More  importantly, the proposed collapse  simulation technique has already been  successfully used in the design of some  real-world supertallbuildings, with  significant savings of tens of thousands of  tons of concrete and steel,whilst achieving  a better seismic performance and safety.    The proposed novel solution for  earthquake disaster simulation of urban  areas usingnonlinear multiple degree-of- freedom (MDOF) model and time-history  analysis delivers several unique advantages:  (1) true representation of the  characteristic featuresof individual  buildings and ground motions; (2) realistic  visualization of earthquakescenarios,  particularly dynamic shaking of buildings  during earthquakes; (3) detailedprediction  of seismic response and losses on each story  of every building at any timeperiod. The  proposed earthquake disaster simulation  technique has been successfullyimplemented  in the seismic performance assessments and  earthquake loss predictions of several  central cities in China. The outcomes of the  simulation as well as thefeedback from the  end users are encouraging, particularly for  the government officialsand/or  administration department personnel with  limited professional knowledge of earthquake  engineering.    The book offers readers a systematic  solution to earthquake disaster simulation  of civil infrastructures. The application  outcomes demonstrate a promising future of  the proposed advanced techniques. The book  provides a long-awaited guide for academics  andgraduate students involving in earthquake  engineering research and teaching  activities. It can also be used by  structural engineers for seismic design of  supertall buildings.
