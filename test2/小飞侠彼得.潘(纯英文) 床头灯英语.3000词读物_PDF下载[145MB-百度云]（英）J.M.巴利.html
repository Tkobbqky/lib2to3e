The Darling familyhowever， could not afford a normal nurse. Insteadthey had to "hire" a different kind of nurse. TheDarlings bought a large dog named Nana， andNana was as good as a human nurse. Nana helpedto bath the children and get their clothes ready. Shewould comfort them when they had bad dreams inthe nights. She even walked with them to school inthe mornings， helping them cross the streets andcarrying an umbrella in her mouth when it rained.Every night， when Wendy， John， and Michaelwere going to bed， Nana would turn on a smallnight light， because the children were all afraid ofthe Neverland. They worried that the Neverlandwas always hiding outside and would come andcapture them if they were not careful. The childrendid not know what the Neverland was like， and eachchild had different ideas about what the people wholived there were like and about what things thathappened there. In fact， the Neverland didn't feel very scary. The children were only scared becausethey worried about losing their family and going toa world where anyt，hing could happen.Some ofthe children's dreams about the Neverlandwere similar. This was because they were all in thesame family and they had all heard the same storiesfrom their mother. Many stories talked about a boynamed Peter Pan. Peter Pan lived in Neverland withthe fairies and he could fly. Wendy especially believedin Peter Pan. Even Mrs. Darling rememberedstories about a boy named Peter Pan from when shewas a child."Peter Pan must be an old man now，" jokedMrs. Darling to Wendy."No， mom!" cried Wendy， "Peter will nevergrow up. He will always be a boy about the sameage and height as me!"Mr. Darling laughed when Wendy spoke aboutPeter Pan. He did not believe in Peter Pan or theNeverland.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《小飞侠彼得·潘》将荒诞的幻想、惊险情节，编织进一个小小的故事里，给读者以强烈的震撼。彼得·潘很小的时候就到了梦幻岛，在那里他可以飞，成了遗失孩子的队长。在一个夏夜，彼得·潘重返伦敦与温迪结识，邀请她去做孩子们的妈妈。温迪带着她的两个兄弟随彼得·潘飞到了梦幻岛——一个海盗居住的小岛，那里住着彼得·潘的死敌胡克船长、喜欢吃人肉的鳄鱼、美丽且勇敢的印第安公主。读这本书的乐趣在于高潮迭起的魔幻探险，在树上飞行，与胡克船长决斗，尤其是被鳄鱼吞下的大钟永不停歇的滴答声，还有胡克那只失去的右手都让人印象深刻。很后，勇敢的孩子们回到家，把彼得·潘留在永远的童年里。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
