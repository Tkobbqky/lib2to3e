And going to the door， he called them.　　They threw down the box， that represented a train， and came in to their father.　　The little girl， her father's favorite， ran up boldly， embraced him， and hung laughingly on his neck， enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers. At last the little girl kissed his face， which was fiushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness， loosed her hands， and was about to run away again; but her father held her back.　　"How is mamma?" he asked， passing his hand over his daughter's smooth， soft little neck. "Good moming，" he said， smiling to the boy， who had comeup to greet him. He was conscious that he loved the boy less， and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it， and did not respond with a smile to his father's chilly smile，　　"Mamma? She is up，" answered the girl.　　Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed. "That means that she's not slept again all night，" he thought.　　"Well， is she cheerful?"　　The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother， and that her mother could not be cheerful， and that her father must be aware of this， and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly. And she blushed for her father. He at once perceived it， and blushed too.　　"I don't know，" she said. "She did not say we must do our lessons， but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandma's."　　"Well， go， Tanya， my darling. Oh， wait a minute， though，" he said， still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.　　He took off the mantelpiece， where he had put it yesterday， a little box of sweets， and gave her two， picking out her favorites， a chocolate and a fondant.　　"For Grisha?" said the little girl， pointing to the chocolate.　　"Yes， yes." And still stroking her little shoulder， he kissed her on the roots of her hair and neck， and let her go.　　"The carriage is ready，" said Matvey; "but there's some one to see you with a petition."　　"Been here long?" asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.　　"Half an hour."　　"How many times have I told you to tell me at once?"　　"One must let you drink your coffee in peace， at least，" said Matvey， in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry.　　"Well， show the person up at once，" said Oblonsky， frowning with vexation.　　The petitioner， the widow of a staff captain Kalinin， came with a request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch， as he generally did， made her sit down， heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her， and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply， and even wrote her， in his large， sprawling， good and legible hand， a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her. Having got rid of the staff captain's widow， Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything. It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget-his wife.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>英语读物；“很经典”英语文库明细（第二辑）；《安娜-卡列尼娜》系俄国19世纪很有名的作家列夫-托尔斯泰的代表作，很早出版于1877年。作品通过安娜的个人人生遭遇，向社会深刻阐释了作家对女性、婚姻、人生、生死等重大问题的深刻思考。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy(1828—1910)，also known as Leo Tolstoy,was a Russian writer who primarily wrote novels and short stories．Tolstoy was a master of realistic fiction and iS widely considered one of the world’S greatest novelists．He iS best known for two long novels，War，and Peace (1869)and Anna Karenina (1877)． Tolstoy first achieved literary acclaim in his 20s for his Sevastopol Sketches (1855)．based on his experiences in the Crimean War．followed by the publication of a semi—autObiographical trilogy of novels．Childhood,Boyhood,atld YoUth (1855—1858)，Tolstoy iS equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views．which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the l 870s．after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and so reformer．</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
