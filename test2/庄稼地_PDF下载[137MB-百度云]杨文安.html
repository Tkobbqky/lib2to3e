我的家乡山东省沂源县李家坡村，是一个偏僻的沂蒙山区小山村。祖先于清朝末年从沂水县逃荒要饭来到这里，至今已有一百三十多年的历史，在这里相继繁衍了七代人。随着时代的变迁，七代人各有不同的人生……特别是父亲的一生，为了党和人民的事业，在无数个难关面前，历经无数次考验，矢志不渝，终究创下了不朽的功绩。我沿着父亲走过的道路，秉承父亲遗志，继承父亲的事业，薪火相传，继续为党和人民做出应有贡献。多年以来，我就一直在想，能否将我和父亲一生走过的创业之路，通过回忆记录下来，相传于后世。但是由于我一直忙忙碌碌，没有实现这个愿望，深感遗憾……终于因为儿子工作的原因，我们举家迁入成都，闲暇之余，为使命所催，以老杇之躯，奋笔疾书，秉烛记叙，望古稀之年能成夙愿，为子孙后代留下一个家族史记，给自己留下一份慰藉。
浅薄和不足之处，敬请指正。
