《天行者》 以中国20世纪90年代贫乏的乡村教育为背景，讲述了一群在贫苦生活中无私为乡村教育事业做出贡献的民办教师为求转正而发生的辛酸故事，也反映出被人们遗忘已久的乡村民办教师曾有过的艰难历程。
本书围绕着西河乡界岭小学三代民办教师转正的故事，以及张英才、余校长、孙四海、万站长、蓝飞和夏雪等人的爱情故事开展起来。这些大故事中穿插着小故事，每个小故事又可以作为下个故事开展的源头，相互交叉汇合，使得小说的叙事精彩纷呈，紧缩而富有张力。
 
The Sky Dwellers describes the lives and struggles of primary school teachers in Jieling, a tiny, fictional community nestled high in remote mountains in China. These teachers are not state teachers, with regular salaries and pensions to look forward to. They are, instead, community teachers (or “minban teachers” – a term which literally translates as “people-supported” teachers) whose wages are paid by the local community and who might not have received much beyond primary school teaching themselves. During the 1960s, 70s and 80s, most children in China were taught by minban teachers. From the early 1990s onwards, the role was gradually phased out, and some minban teachers were lucky enough to become state teachers.
 
A minban teacher’s life was one of poverty. State subsidies provided only part of their wages and local cadres were supposed to make up the rest from often very limited village funds. But often the cadres did not pay on time, or at all. Inevitably, this would result in tensions – a theme explored in this novel.
 
Each of the teachers in the book responds differently to the pressures of life as a minban teacher. But the novel is not just about the teachers’ lives, it also deals with the impact they had on the children and the community they served. Set in the 1990s, a time of great social and cultural change in China, The Sky Dwellers is a compelling, personal and moving account of a part of China’s recent past which is often overlooked.
