<p>书名:工程有限元分析</p><p>作者:崔德渝</p><p>页数:323</p><p>定价:¥72.0</p><p>出版社:北京航空航天大学出版社</p><p>出版日期:2013-01-01</p><p>ISBN:9787512410183</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　this textbook presents the necessary concepts， principles and
general procedure of finite element method （fem） which are
primarily applied for linearly elastic structural analysis
including plane problems， axisymmetric problems， space problems，
plates and shells and fracture mechanics. the fem of heat transfer
in brief is also incorporated. some straightforward examples are
introduced to demonstrate a complete and detailed finite element
procedure. the aim of the text is to provide the fundamental
theories and numerical methodology in finite element analysis. it
focuses on the derivation of key governing equations of the fem and
its engineering application.
　　this text can be regarded as a text or reference book for the
university under- and post-graduate students or engineers whose
majors are related to mechanics， aerospace， mechanical and civil
engineering， heat transfer and so on.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
