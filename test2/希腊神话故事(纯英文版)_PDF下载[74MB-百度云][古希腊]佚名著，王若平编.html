The moonlight was shining in through the window， and it made the box look bright and wonderful. The box itself was not fancy or special. It was just a common box with a large lock on the front. Pandora reached into her pocket and felt the key inside for she had kept the key there since Zeus had given it to her.The key felt warm in her hand and sent excitement through her body. Her curiosity grew and grew as she walked closer and closer to the box， but then　　she remembered Zeus' words and turned away.　　She got back into bed with Epimetheus， but was not able to sleep. She kept thinking a'oout the box and wondering what was inside. Finally， Pando-　　ra got up and went to the room where the box sat.She carried the box outside into the garden， dug a deep hole in the middle of a group of flowers， and placed the box inside. She looked down at it one last time before covering it with the earth. She then took several large stones and piled them on top of the hole. She was tired from her work and returned to bed to sleep with Epimetheus.　　As she slept， she had a dream about the box. In her dream， the box was bright and beautiful， and it softly whispered her name over and over again，"Pandora... Pandora..." it said. Then she took the key out of her pocket and carefully inserted it into the lock. As she turned the key， the box became even brighter and more beautiful. When she opened the top， she was amazed because the box was filled with the most beautiful jewels that she had ever seen! These were her gift from Zeus! But why wasn't she supposed to open it? With those jew-els， she and Epimetheus could live like a King and Queen!　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　西方文明在整个人类文明中占有重要的地位。西方文明的核心是由“两希”构成。一个是希伯来文化，其高成就为犹太人创作的《圣经》，它是西方文明发源的灵感源泉之一；另一个是比希伯来文化更为古老的希腊文化，其辉煌灿烂文化的种子就包孕在希腊神话史诗中。　　作为西方文化的根源，希腊神话对世界的影响无疑是巨大的。《床头灯英语·3000词读物（纯英文版）：希腊神话故事》波澜壮阔的文化氛围、悲壮的历史、光怪陆离的故事，为读者掀开了那令世界难以忘怀的扉页，敞开了一扇观察和认识古希腊乃至欧洲文化的窗口。内容包括潘多拉魔盒、俄耳甫斯与欧律狄刻的生死恋、九头蛇怪海德拉、金苹果、雅典娜女神、泰坦擎天神、迈达斯国王的点金术、金羊毛……　　希腊神话的核心是以人为本，歌颂了人的美好，坚信人的力量，虽名为神话，实为人的神话。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
