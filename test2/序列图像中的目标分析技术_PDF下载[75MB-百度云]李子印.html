本书以序列图像中目标分析技术的基本过程为主线，系统地介绍了目标分析的基本理论，详细讲解了作者的研究成果。绪论重点对序列图像中目标分析技术的研究现状进行了分析。目检测部分，提出了一种基本的视频运动目标检测技术框架；在此基础上提出了两种改进的目标检测算法，可分别用于需要精确检测目标和阈值化后目标连通性较差的应用场合；针对帧间差分法的不足，提出了一种基于差分背景融合建模的目标检测算法。目标定位部分，提出了一种基于减法聚类算法的目标定位技术和一种椭圆域减法聚类目标定位方法；提出了减法聚类目标定位算法的七点优化技术；另外，提出了一种基于非参数核密度估计的目标定位技术，可根据应用灵活选择核函数估计样本点的密度值分布；针对减法聚类技术复杂度高的问题，提出了一种基于nystr?m密度值逼近的减法聚类方法。目标运动估计部分，为了降低运动估计的计算复杂度，提出了一种基于运动场预测的六边形块运动估计算法和一种基于运动场预测的部分失真运动估计算法；另外，对umhexagons算法进行了改进。目标跟踪与识别部分，针对复杂背景下的目标跟踪，提出了一种基于图像感知哈希技术的目标跟踪算法；针对遮挡情况，提出了一种自适应步长选择的ncc图像匹配算法；*后，采用基于团块和轨迹分析的方法实现了区域入侵、人体跌倒、遗留物检测、人体徘徊四种异常行为的判定。
