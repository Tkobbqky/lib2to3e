In today's scientific community a toxicologist is an individual who is responsible for predicting the toxic or harmful nature of a substance. A toxicologist is responsible for designing experiments that will supply the data necessary to assess the toxicity of materials. These data help toxicologists makepredictions about the hazardous nature of materials tested and their potential impact on the  environment and on human populations. A toxicologist must be a multifunctional scientist， familiar with pharmacology， biochemistry， pharmacodynamics， physiology， inorganic and organic chemistry， and cellular and molecular biology. Acute toxicity，  subchronic， chronic， and reproductive tests， are the principal experiments conducted in a toxicology laboratory.　　In addition， there are many types of cancers that affect humans and other species. Learning the cause， progression， diagnosis， and treatment for these diseases. Animals are frequently used in such studies， especially where cause， early diagnosis， and untested treatment methods are being evaluated. Animal models of cancer are generally classified as  two types， induced disease and spontaneous disease.　　15.1  Acute Toxicity Tests　　In most acute （in this case the term acute refers to short-term） toxicity tests， an animal such as a mouse is given a single dose of a test substance. One measure of acute toxicity is the lethal dose 50 （LDso ） .  This is defined as the dose of a substance that kills 50 percent of the animals tested. Other acute studies are set up to assess the toxicity of products placed in contact with animal tissue to evaluate local tissue irritation. Examples of such tests are the Draize skin and eye assays. Acute toxicity tests utilizing animals have been criticized， mainly if they are used to evaluate non-pharmaceuticals such as cosmetics and household products. Currently a large number of researches are underway seeking alternatives to the use of the LDso in animals. Until the non-animal alternative tests have proved reliable， it is most certain that tests using animals will continue to be used as the definitive means of maintaining public safety.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书介绍了动物科学在我国和世界各国的发展历史的同时，对常见实验动物的解剖和生理特点，繁殖和管理方法，大鼠、小鼠、兔、猫、狗、猪、猴和蛙类等在医学、药学和毒理学中的用途都进行了全面论述。书中还对转基因动物和转基因技术和常用动物实验方法进行了介绍。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
