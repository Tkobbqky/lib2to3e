Mediocrity was held by the ancient sages to be golden， that is to say， precious， praised by all men， and pleasing in all places. Read the sacred Bible， you will find the prayers of those who asked moderately were never unanswered. For example， little dapper Zaccheus， whose body and relics the monks of St. Garlick， near Orleans， boast of having， and nickname him St. Sylvanus； he only wished to see our blessed Saviour near Jerusalem. It was but a small request， and no more than anybody then might pretend to. But alas! he was but low-built； and one of so diminutive a size， among the crowd， could not so much as get a glimpse of him. Well then he struts， stands on tiptoes， bustles， and bestirs his stumps， shoves and makes way， and with much ado clambers up a sycamore. Upon this， the Lord， who knew his sincere affection， presented himself to his sight， and was not only seen by him， but heard also； nay， what is more， he came to his house and blessed his family.　　One of the sons of the prophets in Israel felling would near the river Jordan， his hatchet forsook the helve and fell to the bottom of the river； so he prayed to have it again （'twas but a small request， mark ye me）， and having a strong faith， he did not throw the hatchet after the helve， as some spirits of contradiction say by way of scandalous blunder， but the helve after the hatchet， as you all properly have it. Presently two great miracles were seen： up sprmgs the hatchet from the bottom of the water， and fixes itself to its old acquaintance the helve. Now had he wished to coach it to heaven in a fiery chariot like Elias， to multiply in seed like Abraham， be as rich as Job， strong as Samson， and beautiful as Absalom， would he have obtained it， d'ye think? I' troth， my friends， I question it very much.　　Now I talk of moderate wishes in point of hatchet （but harkee me， be sure you don't forget when we ought to drink）， I will tell you what is written among the apologues of wise Aesop the Frenchman. I mean the Phrygian and Trojan， as Max. Planudes makes him； from which people， according to the most faithful chroniclers， the noble French are descended. Aelian writes that he was of Thrace and Agathias， after Herodotus， that he was of Samos； 'tis all one to Frank. In his time lived a poor honest country fellow of Gravot， Tom Wellhung by name， a wood-cleaver by trade， who in that low drudgery made shift so to pick up a sorry livelihood. It happened that he lost his hatchet. Now tell me who ever had more cause to be vexed than poor Tom? Alas， his whole estate and life depended on his hatchet； by his hatchet he earned many a fair penny of the best woodmongers or logmerchants among whom he went a-jobbing； for want of his hatchet he was like to starve； and had death but met with him six days after without a hatchet， the grim fiend would have mowed him down in the twinkling of a bedstaff. In this sad case he began to be in a heavy taking， and called upon Jupiter with the most eloquent prayers-for you know necessity was the mother of eloquence. With the whites of his eyes turned up towards heaven， down on his marrow-bones， his arms reared high， his fingers stretched wide， and his head bare， the poor wretch without ceasing was roaring out， by way oflitany， at every repetition of his supplications， My hatchet， Lord Jupiter， my hatchet! my hatchet! only my hatchet， O Jupiter， or money to buy another， and nothing else! alas， my poor hatchet!　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>  
弗朗索瓦·拉伯雷（约1483 至1494 - 1553) 是文艺复兴时期的法国作家。同时他也是医生，人文主义积极倡导者。当然他重要的身份是僧侣和希腊语初学者。人们一般地都把他看作幻想小说作家、讽刺小说作者。他曾创作过不少粗俗的甚至不堪入耳的段子以及下流歌曲，当然，他为世人所熟悉的文学作品，就是眼前这部《巨人传》。这部书的出版，奠定了拉伯雷在世界文学史上的重要地位，人们都将其看成是世界文学史上重要的作家之一，现代欧洲文学的开启者。他的姓氏“拉伯雷”甚至被用来当作形容词来使用，以表达对他的敬佩。“拉伯雷的，拉伯雷式”的意义被词典界定为：“具有极大幽默感的，大胆自然主义描写的”。 
也正由于拉伯雷的近乎传奇色彩的写作人生，他还活着时，他的生活的点点滴滴就被人高度关注与追捧，也因此，蒙上一层神秘阴影。一个僧人，一个医生，又是一个作家，拉伯雷在教皇允许下，完成了由讽刺作家朝教会领导者的角色的转换。而作为教会领导者，更需要的是大度容忍与更具博文识广的眼界。于是，人们就总能在法国知识界的中心里昂市发现他的身影。也正是在这个知识分子云集之处，他发表了《巨人传》。一面是讽刺小说家，另面则是悲天悯人的人文主义者，拉伯雷在这两种角色中徘徊着。他对自己书中描绘的人物，因此充满了矛盾复杂的情感。当然，拉伯雷在试图表达自己观点时所采取的立场是前后一致的。也因之遭致他同时代的一些与其立场观点相佐的人士的围攻，这其中就有大名鼎鼎的马丁·路德。不过也因此使他的名气更大，影响力更广。
