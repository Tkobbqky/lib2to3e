Every evening， Sir Charles went for a walk in the gardens of Baskerville Hall. His favorite place to walk was down a path， between two rows of trees. This path is the famous "Yew Alley" of Baskerville Hall. On the night of June 4， he went out to walk and to smoke his cigar， as he often did. Sir Charles was going to London the next morning， and Barrymore， his head servant， was inside the house packing his suitcases. But by midnight， Barrymore realized that Sir Charles had not returned. So he went to look for him. He saw that the door of the house was open. That day had been rainy and wet， so Barrymore could see the footprints left by Sir Charles' shoes as he had walked down the path of trees. Half way down this path is a gate， which leads to the moor. There were signs that Sir Charles had stood at this gate for some time， before continuing his walk. Barrymore followed the footprints to the end of the path and there he found Sir Charles' body.　　Barrymore told the police an interesting detail about these footprints. He said that they changed between the gate leading to the moor and the end of the path of trees. As far as the moor gate， all the footprints were normal. But Barrymore saw only toe prints in the ground after Sir Charles passed this gate. Barrymore thought that Sir Charles had walked on his toes.　　A man called Murphy， who buys and sells horses， was close to Baskerville Hall when Sir Charles died. This man is known in the town for his drunkenness， and that night he had been drinking a lot of beer as usual. However， he swore that he heard someone shouting， as if they were calling for help . The shouts came from the direction of Baskerville Hall.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《福尔摩斯探案故事：巴斯克维尔猎犬》以离奇和经典著称，翻开此书，犹如走进了19世纪末的伦敦，来到了雾气沉沉的贝克街，和福尔摩斯一起去拨开重重迷雾，寻找真相。　　詹姆斯·莫蒂默医生带给夏洛克·福尔摩斯一些神秘的手稿，这些手稿来自查尔斯·巴斯克维尔爵士，3个月前他忽遭惨死。手稿中记载了100多年前巴斯克维尔家族的族长雨果·巴斯克维尔为非作歹，*终命丧于传说中可怕的巴斯克维尔猎犬口中。从那以后，巴斯克维尔家族就笼罩在族长所犯罪行的阴影下，家族里的许多人都以蹊跷而恐怖的方式死去。这起命案到底是诅咒，还是有人利用传说来设计杀人？福尔摩斯该如何解开隐藏在传说中的死亡含义？　　柯南·道尔，英国小说家，因成功地塑造了侦探人物夏洛克·福尔摩斯，成为历史上重要的侦探小说作家，《福尔摩斯探案故事：巴斯克维尔猎犬》是其得意的长篇杰作之一。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
