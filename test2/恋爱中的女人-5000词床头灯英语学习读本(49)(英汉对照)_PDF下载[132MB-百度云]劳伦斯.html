     One afternoon,  as Ursula wandered along the course of a<br/>
bright little stream near Willey Water, she came upon Birkin, fixing<br/>
a small boat. The moment he saw her, he dropped his tools and<br/>
came forward, saying:  "How do you do? Help me get the boat in<br/>
the water, will you?"  he asked.<br/>
     With combined efforts they turned over the heavy boat and set<br/>
it in the water.  In a moment he was with her again, and she<br/>
stepped into the wet boat. They landed under a willow tree. Ursula<br/>
looked at him closely. She had not see,n him since Breadalby. He<br/>
was very thin and hollow, with a ghastly look in his face.<br/>
      "You have been iii,  haven't you?"  she asked, rather re-<br/>
pulsed.<br/>
      "Yes,"  he replied coldly.<br/>
      "Has it made you frightened?"  she asked.<br/>
      "What of"  he asked, turning his eyes to look at her.<br/>
      "It is frightening to be very iii, isn't it?"  she said.<br/>
      "It isn't pleasant,"  he said. "Whether one is really afraid of<br/>
death, or not, I have never decided. In one mood, not a bit, in an-<br/>
other, very much. I don't know what really to do."<br/>
      "Why should you always be doing?"  she retorted. "I think it<br/>
is much better to do nothing but just be oneself, like a blossoming<br/>
flower. And why is it,"  she asked at length, "that there is no<br/>
flowering, no dignity of human life now?"<br/>
      "The whole idea is dead. Humanity itself is dryrotten, really.<br/>
 第七章<br/>
小岛<br/>
  一天下午，厄秀拉沿着威利湖附近的一条明丽的<br/>
小溪漫步时偶遇伯金，当时他正在修一条小船。他一<br/>
看到她就放下手中的工具，走上前来招呼道：  。你好<br/>
啊!帮我把这船弄到水里去，好吗?”他问道。<br/>
    <br/>
  两个人合力把那条沉重的船翻了过来，推入水<br/>
中。片刻之后，他和她又在一起了。她踏进湿漉漉的<br/>
小船中。船停泊在一棵柳树下。厄秀拉细细打量着<br/>
他，自布莱德比一别之后，她再也没见过他。他很干<br/>
瘪消瘦。面色惨白。<br/>
    “你生了场病。是吗?”她有些反感地问。<br/>
    “是的。他冷冷地回答。<br/>
    "这场病让你害怕了吗?”她说。<br/>
    “怕什么?”他边问边转过来望着她。<br/>
    “生病很可怕，不是吗?。她说。<br/>
    “生病当然不舒服。”他说，“至于人是否真怕<br/>
死，我还说不准。心情不好时，一点也不怕；心情好<br/>
时，又非常怕。我也弄不清。”<br/>
    “为什么你总要做事情呢?”她反驳道。。我觉得<br/>
*好还是什么也不干，顺其自然，就像花儿开放一<br/>
样。”她*后又问道，  “为什么现在人们的生命之花<br/>
不再开放，尊严消失殆尽了呢?”<br/>
    “整个意识已经死了。人类本身已经枯萎腐烂，<br/>
 Human lives have no significance any longer    their insides are<br/>
full of bitter, corrupt ash."<br/>
     "But there are good people,"  protested Ursula.<br/>
     "Good enough for the life of today. But mankind is a dead<br/>
tree."<br/>
     "And if it is so, why is it?"  she asked, hostile. They were<br/>
rousing each other to a fine passion of opposition.<br/>
     "Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust? Because they<br/>
won't fall off the tree when they're ripe. They hang on to their old<br/>
positions when the position is over-past, till they become mined<br/>
with little worms and dry-rot."<br/>
     "But even if everybodv is wrong -- where are you right?"<br/>
she cried, "where are you any better?"<br/>
     "I?    I'm not fight,"  he cried back. "At least my only right-<br/>
ness lies in the fact that I know it. I detest what I am. I hate myself<br/>
as a human being. Humanity is a huge lie, and a huge lie is less<br/>
than a small truth. Humanity is less, far less than the individual,<br/>
because the individual may sometimes be capable of troth, and hu-<br/>
manity is a tree of lies."<br/>
     "But,"  said Ursula sadly, "that doesn't alter the fact that<br/>
love is the greatest, does it? What they do doesn't alter the troth of<br/>
what they say, does it?"</p>]
