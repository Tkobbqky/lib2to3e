It is believed that the prices of raw and processed material, labor resource, and energy sources will keep increasing in the near future, which is expected to bring unfavorable effects to China's agricultural export to ASEAN, specifically, lack of labor resource and salary increasing will affect significantly the cost of the agricultural products that are processed by enterprises in eastern China, and the cost rise of energy sources and shipping will have even bigger effects on the export of agricultural products from central and western area of China, and the appreciation of RMB exchange rate will impose great pressure on the industries that signs future export contract and exports processed imported material, such as sea products.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>For example, the import quota for corn is 54440 million tons which is subject to a 20% tariff rate, while out-of-quota corn import is subject to a 73.8% tariff rate. This is the same to Malaysia; the tariff rates of some products beyond access commitment are subject to high ad valorem or specific duty, the highest ad valorem duty up to 160%, such as swine products, poultry products, milk,eggs, round cabbage, coffee beans, sugar.Some ASEAN countries lay down strict SPS measures, such as the HALAL certificate of Malaysia to the import of poultry and livestock products, whose certificating process is thought to lack of transparency by many enterprises,which affects the export of relative products of China to Malaysia.At the same time, the import restriction and anti-dumping from ASEAN upon Chinese agricultural products occurs from time to time. For example,Indonesia stopped the import of shrimp products from China in 2004, and imposed 9.5% final anti-dumping duty on corn flour product of China in Nov.of 2005.The Continuous Rising on Export CostIn recent years, affected by the rise in the prices of raw and processed material, labor cost, energy and shipping fares, and the increase in currency exchanging cost caused by the fluctuating of exchange rate, the general export cost of Chinese agricultural products has kept increasing.
