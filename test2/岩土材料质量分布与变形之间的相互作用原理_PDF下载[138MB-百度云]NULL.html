  《岩土材料质量分布与变形之间的相互作用原理(英文版)》主要内容简介：Rock and soil are the major constituent materials of the lithosphere of the earth. They are also the most widely used engineering materials. Rock and soil exhibit some remarkable characteristics of deformation and strength behavior, such as the pressure sensitivity(or pressure dependency), shear dilatancy, dependency of stress path etc.  The two phenomena of pressure sensitivity and shear dilatancy have long been known by people. However, their origin of generation is not explained rationally yet.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  插图：Loading may induce strain hardening, whereas unloading or reloading only re-sults in elastic deformation. The loading-unloading-reloading process can be de-scribed by means of a family of yield surfaces with a hardening parameter.However, it is frequently observed in geotechnical structures that even undermonotonic loading conditions, the stress paths with different directions can alsoinduce different plastic responses of geotechnical materials.  Now the fact thatthe response of geotechnical materials is dependent upon the stress path has beenrecognized by most of investigators and engineers. However, there are differentopinions about its origin of creation, for example, some researchers attribute thedependency of stress path to anisotropy, inelasticity and dependence of history ofmaterials （e.g., see （wood, 1990））, others believe that it is due to the cross effectsof the mean normal stress and deviator stress（e.g., see （Sun et al., 1987））.The stress paths that are actually followed by soil elements in various geotech-nical structures, such as tunnel, slope, deep foundation etc., are quite different.Some typical cases of stress paths encountered in practical geotechnical engi-neering will be presented as follows.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
