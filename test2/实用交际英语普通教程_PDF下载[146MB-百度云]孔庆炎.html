By age 10, he was trying out arias. As he entered his teen years, his talent became more and more obvious. His family spent hours discussing his future. They knew he longed to be a great singer. They decided to support him financially until he turned 30. If Pavarotti did not achieve success by that time, he would have to choose a new career.Pavarotti began to study voice in 1955 and threw himself passionately into his lessons. Hour after hour he practiced exercises to strengthen his voice. Six years passed and no singing jobs came his way.In 1961, however, he entered.an international competition for young singers m and he won！ First prize was the lead role in a local opera production. Pavarotti gave an outstanding performance in the opera and began to make a name for himself.Pavarotti took roles in opera around Italy, and in 1963, he appeared at Covent Garden m the Royal Opera House in London. His performance brought him international attention.In 1968, the New York's world-famous Metropolitan Opera invited him to sing with them. Days before he was to perform, he caught the flu. He tried to sing, but was unable to complete his perfor- mance. Five years later, however, he returned to the Met and sang magnificently. In one aria, he hit six high Cs.The Italian tenor began to tour the world, bringing opera music to everyone. Soon every concert Pavarotti gave drew huge crowds. At a concert in Berlin in 1988, the audience refused to leave after his performance. They applauded for over an hour and recalled Pavarotti to the stage 165 times~ In 1990, he performed with two other famous tenors, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as "The Three Tenors", to the delight of everyone.Full of life and energy, Pavarotti never slows down.
