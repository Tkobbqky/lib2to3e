  《守恒定律用的数值法》内容简介：These notes developed from a course on the numerical solution of conservation lawsfirst taught at the University of Washington in the fall of 1988 and then at ETH duringthe following spring.The overall emphasis is on studying the mathematical tools that are essential in de-veloping, analyzing, and successfully using numerical methods for nonlinear systems ofconservation laws, particularly for problems involving shock waves. A reasonable un-derstanding of the mathematical structure of these equations and their solutions is firstrequired, and Part I of these notes deals with this theory. Part II deals more directly withnumerical methods, again with the emphasis on general tools that are of broad use. Ihave stressed the underlying ideas used in various classes of methods rather than present-ing the most sophisticated methods in great detail. My aim was to provide a sufficientbackground that students could then approach the current research literature with thenecessary tools and understanding.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
