  插图：Guangdong（Yue for short）is located in South China，with an area of 178，000 square kilometers，and a population of 80 million.  It adjoins the Wuling Mountains to the north and the South China Sea to the south，with a landscape sloping from north to south. It’s mountainous in north，and in the south there are coastal plains，hills and tablelands .The deltas of the Pearl River and Han River are its chief plains .The West River，North River and East River known as“The Peal River System’’as well as Han River are Guangdong’s main water ways. Its coastline is long and zigzag with numerous offshore is lands. With the Tropic of Cancer running across its central land，Guangdong is，in the main，subject to south sub-tropical humid climate .Its abundant mineral resources include tungsten，tin，antimony，molybdenum，copper，zinc andlead，which all hold an important position in China.In China，the Guangdong province is synonymous with affluence. Located on the southeastern coast of the country，its surrounds the tourist meccas of-Ma-cau and Hong Kong，an enviable situation that has propelled the region into a major economic center for the country of China .It is also home to the Cantonese people.Due to widespread emigration by the Cantonese in the 19th and 20th centuries towards the Western Hemisphere，many of the Chinese cultural signifiers that have become encompassed by the western world derives from this group .But the families that remained in Guangdong China have done quite all fight for themselves，as a whole .Economic reforms in 1979 paved the way for the region’supward growth-feasting off a combination of Hong Kong infused growth and the province's everg rowing manufacturing industries，the Guangdong Province has transformed itself from aneconomic nonentity into a major player in current China.  Topography has also played a large part in forging the identity of Guangdong China .Since its inception into the Chinese empire，mountains cut off the region from Central China，allowing Guangdong an amount of autonomy that isn’t found much throughout theremainder of the country. Despite the uniqueness of the region，however，not many touristsspend much time in Guangdong China. There just aren’t a lot of sights in the province that appeal to anyone outside of the average executives who frequent the area on business trips.The capital of the Guangdong province is the sprawling strip mall of Guangzhou.Ifthe province is well-known as a financial powerhouse，Guangzhou is appropriately on the ore front-everything from the large buildings to the tiny roadside shops offer pretty much any thing you can dream of.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
